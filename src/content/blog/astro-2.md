First of all I created a +page.ts file inside my todo route and created a load function of the type PageLoad . I have fetched the json response from dummyjson inside the function and returned an array of todos from the response. The type t at the beginning is optional and you may not use it but the type todo is important if you want end-to-end type-safety (also itâ€™s a good practice to keep all the types in a separate file and import them, instead of cluttering the main file).

## hello

SvelteKit then generates the types for the load function which could be used in our +page.svelte. In the src/routes/todo/+page.svelte , we first need to import the generated types and then export it as data . The next part is pretty easy if you already know Svelte syntax, we just need to iterated over the array of list and list them down.

## hello two

If you do everything correctly and then head over to localhost:5173/todo, you would be able to see something like this.
